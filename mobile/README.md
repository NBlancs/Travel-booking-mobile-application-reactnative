# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹
## Mobile app quick start

This Expo Router app includes a basic auth flow (Login/Register) and a tabbed Dashboard. Auth uses hardcoded demo credentials for now.

- Login demo user: `user@example.com`
- Password: `password123`

### Run

1. Install dependencies
2. Start Expo

```
npm install
npm run start
```

Open the app in Expo Go (Android/iOS) or press `w` for web.

### Structure

- `app/_layout.tsx` â€“ wraps the app with AuthProvider
- `app/(auth)/*` â€“ Login and Register screens
- `app/(tabs)/*` â€“ Dashboard (index) and Settings tab
- `app/index.tsx` â€“ redirects to `(auth)` or `(tabs)` based on auth state

Replace the hardcoded auth in `context/AuthContext.tsx` with real API calls when ready.
This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
